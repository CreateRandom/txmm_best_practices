1) Module structure, separation into different files
2) Have a requirements.py file + using virtual environments

3) Debugging, break points, stepping through execution frames
4) Refactoring with PyCharm (renaming / moving)

5) Data loading with pandas
6) Inspecting your data and the class distribution
7) Train - val - test split, only use test at the very end

8) Sklearn interface using transform, fit and fit_transform
9) Simple bag-of-words classification with Naive Bayes
10) Class imbalance and the inadequacy of accuracy --> ROC and AUC
11) Error analysis and testing your model

12) Using a pipeline for easier model training
13) The need for grid search
14) Cross-validation, using GridSearchCV

15) Possible outlook on word embeddings, loading and using them
